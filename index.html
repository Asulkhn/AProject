            <h2>Essay</h2>
            <p>My name is Asulkhan, and I'm 18 years old. I've been learning in high school-gymnasium for russian speaking children. I made little achievements by getting place in chess tournament in school, participating in swimming tournament, learning english to nearly advanced level by myself and for sometime in Darina linguistic center where i climbed to B2 level comparatively very quickly. I've also been having some fum with electric devices by deconstructing them and messing with their insides and learning something about computer parts by watching about them in youtube. I've been in STEM AP course where I've made some electric networks on Arduino and did some html programming. I've made a site with some unobtrusive interface and a simple design. I've watched about how CPU works and what programms could test it part by part, and how i could mess with it. Most of such videos were english as better and more entertainable authors were in english communities. I've watched a large quantity of english videos and surfing english posts, which contributed to my language proficiency, as I've also practised some of my knowledge in linguocentre. I reached 6.5 IELTS without really preparing much, but i think i could stretch it to 7.5.I've also been learning japanese, though with not much success as the language is very hard to learn and I'm very unfamiliar with japanese culture. I had developed some skills, even though i haven't reached heights, but I believe I have enough potential to work in the desirable area in another country, and speaking with people from other countries naturally.</p>
